## Override System ://

Greetings! Welcome to the system dossier page of Override System. We're traumagenic, and probably best known around the community for being the creator of Plural Hub. As fitting of our data motif, we're all generally really into technology and everything related to computers, including video games.

Seishin currently acts as the social face of our system. If you need to get in touch with us ASAP, your best bet is to reach out to her. We love meeting new systems of all types, so don't be afraid to say hello.
