The embodiment of goose energy. Free-spirited and goofy. She enjoys dealing with tech and helping maintain the system's daily schedule. She also has a stubborn streak, refusing to back down once she sets her mind on something. All in all, Kaori is essentially the big sister in the system, doing a little bit of everything to keep things running smoothly to the best of her ability.

â€” `I've been dreaming about disaster.`
