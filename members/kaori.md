Hi! I'm Kaori. I'm the one that set up this little website dossier for us. I joined the system in early July of 2019, arriving shortly after Aroma did. She and I are kind of like the two different sides to a coin together. I annoy her a lot, but we look out for each other.

I like singing (though our body isn't very good at it), rhythm games (especially Cytus, haha!), and doing some light tech stuff.
