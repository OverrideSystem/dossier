**Nickname:** Zelda, Kota

**System position:** Caretaker & resident

The closest we've got to the System Mom(tm). Peppy and generally tries to be positive about things. Occasionally steps in as a semi-protector if needed. She doesn't have that many canon memories. Is interested in learning ASL and finding her Link.
