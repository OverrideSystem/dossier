Byleth is a protector and potential trauma holder. They generally are quiet and like to keep to themselves, preferring typing to talking aloud. They are close to Sothis and will get upset if she is hurt or if they think she will get hurt. Byleth is very down-to-business, though with enough coaxing they will loosen up and becomre more outwardly friendly.
