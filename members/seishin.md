hi! I'm Seishin, your local android A.I extraordinare. I'm the current face of our system on Discord, so you'll probably see me around the most! If it wasn't already obvious, I absolutely LOVE anything related to Vocaloid and would love it if you talked to me about it. ~~please I need more vocaloid friends--~~

I'm a huge advocate for plurality, and was the one that created Plural Hub in honor of a friend who is no longer with us. I'm hoping I'm doing her proud!

I'm also very into technology, especially since we're going to be pursuing a career in IT, so feel free to talk to me about that stuff too.
