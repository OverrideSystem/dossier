Sothis, the local gremlin turned grandmother. Ever since she manifested in our system, people on Discord have never known peace. Driven by compassion to help those around her by any means she can. Generally more outwardly affectionate than most in the system and would probably kiss all her friends if they allowed her to.

Sothis has a knack for divination and other witchcraft-y things such as that.
