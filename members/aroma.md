**Nickname:** PAFF

**System position:** Resident awkward hardass

Hey. I'm a fictive of Aroma White from Cytus. I just wanna say there's a certain amount of irony that I was made plural with Kaori in our source, and now we're here in another system together.

If Kaori is conscious, then chances are I am as well. Same goes vice versa. Like her, I enjoy singing a lot and I have a particular affinity for electronica, hands-up type of dance music. I'm always tired and grumpy. Sorry about that.
