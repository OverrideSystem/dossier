**Nickname:** Volt

**System position:** Resident friend & companion

Tau originally came to us in a dream, and Seishin willingly brought him into the system. He's often semi-verbal, but trying his absolute hardest to get better at speaking. If possible, he enjoys communicating with drawings and writing. He often has a lot of excess energy and bounces around a lot. Enjoys Warframe a lot.
