**Nickname:** GHOST

**System position:** Co-Host

Hey, I'm Kaide. I'm also jokingly known as "the invisible co-host" since I'm not super active on Discord now days, but I'm around plenty IRL. Downside of being so closely tied to Seishin is that she usually always says what I'm thinking. There's not a ton to say about me. Perhaps you could say I'm the less excitable side of Seishin? On Discord, anyway. IRL I'm a bit of a bumbling, awkward mess.

I like writing and video games a lot. Also dragons. Lots of dragons. I'm a hoe for aesthetics and street fashion, so hmu if you got any of that to show.
